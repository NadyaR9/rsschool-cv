## About myself

_I had the opportunity to try different directions of IT, during my studies at the university. I tried to program in assembly language, studied basic data structures in C ++, learned the principles of OOP in C # and Java. But only web and mobile development could interest me. I have enjoyed doing course projects on these topics. Therefore, I chose the frontend as the direction in which I would like to develop._
